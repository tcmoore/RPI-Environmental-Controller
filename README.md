# RPI-Environmental-Controller

This is my design of a Raspberry PI B Environmental Controller. This design will have many stages until completion.  Check documentation on this github repository for detailed descriptions of the design.

Design goals are:
-Read Temp
-Read Humidity
-Read Soil Moisture
-Turn on/off fan based on temp & humidity
-provide alarms for over/under values of temp/humidity/soil moisture

Icing on the cake would be:
-Visual Display
-Interactive controls (IE Buttons) for changing env values
-IoT/Web page access/controll
-push alarms to me via text/email
-add water to soil based on soil moisture value
-turn grow lights on/off using RPI
