# RPI-Environmental-Controller

This is my design of a Raspberry PI B Environmental Controller. This design will have many stages until completion.  Check documentation on this github repository for detailed descriptions of the design.

Design goals are:
- Read Temp
- Read Humidity
- Read Soil Moisture
- Turn on/off fan based on temp & humidity
- Provide alarms for over/under values of temp/humidity/soil moisture

Icing on the cake would be:
- Visual Display
- Interactive controls (IE Buttons) for changing env values
- IoT/Web page access/controll
- Push alarms to me via text/email
- Add water to soil based on soil moisture value
- Turn grow lights on/off using RPI
